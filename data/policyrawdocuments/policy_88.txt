Site Alteration
A by-law of the City of Ottawa to protect its agricultural resources and natural heritage features from negative impacts caused by site alteration, and to prevent drainage issues and public nuisances resulting from site alteration activities.
The Site Alteration By-law was approved by City Council on May 9, 2018.  It will come into full force and effect at the next Council meeting on May 23, 2018.  You can review the final by-law by accessing the agenda or minutes of the Council meeting on the City’s E-Agenda web page. 
Also available is additional information to help residents understand how the by-law affects them.
The by-law was developed in consultation with key stakeholders, using the City’s existing Drainage By-law as a foundation.  It replaces the Drainage By-law and the former municipalities’ topsoil protection by-laws.  It does not apply to any area already regulated by one of our local Conservation Authorities, such as a floodplain or a significant wetland.
