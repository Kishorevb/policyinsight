How to use this Appendix


This Appendix lists all of the amending by-laws to the City of Ottawa Zoning By-law, by by-law number, in descending numerical order, beginning with the most recently enacted by-laws.
The Appendix is updated on a regular basis, subsequent to every Council meeting where Ottawa City Council enacts zoning amendment or interim control by-laws.
For each amending by-law added to the Appendix, two links are provided in the amending by-law’s “Date By-law Enacted By Council” column. The links are to the “City Council & Committee Agendas & Minutes” Section of the City’s website, to the City Council meeting in which the amending by-law was enacted by Council.
One link is to the related zoning amendment report, which includes committee’s recommendation to City Council.


The second link is to the Disposition/Minutes of the relevant Council meeting, to allow users to determine how Council “disposed” of the amendment.


The status of each amendment is provided in the fourth column.

Please Note
: This Appendix does not form part of the Zoning By-law, but is provided for reference purposes only. Although the Appendix is updated regularly, the amending provisions of individual amending by-laws are incorporated into the Consolidation’s text, schedules and zoning map, only upon an amendment coming into full force and effect, i.e. the amending by-law’s appeal period has expired and no appeals against the by-law have been received, or appeals were received and a decision to uphold the by-law has been received from the Ontario Municipal Board.
