Ontario Land Tribunal


During the July 12, 2021 Ontario Land Tribunal (OLT) hearing (Case No. MM210013), the Tribunal considered the appeals filed challenging the ward boundary revisions contained in the City of Ottawa’s Ward Boundary By-law No. 2021-3 (the "By-law").
The Tribunal made an 
Order
 modifying the By-law to include the specific ward boundary modifications approved by Council on April 14, 2021, as referenced in the 
April 16, 2021 Ottawa Ward Boundary project update
. The OLT decision will be available on its website in the coming days and available through the above link. The Tribunal further dismissed the balance of the appeals and did not order any other changes to the By-law.
By-law No. 2021-3 has been modified to include revised Schedules A-16, A-17 and A-19 as provided in the OLT Order.
