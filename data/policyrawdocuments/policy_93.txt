CITY CLERK
MAYOR
A by-law of the City of Ottawa to regulate special events on City streets. Enacted by City Council at its meeting of July 11, 2001.


Demonstrations


Definition: For our purposes, a demonstration is a spontaneous or planned collection of people using the road allowance as a place to express an opinion. This type of event can be stationary (confined to a specific location) or one which moves from one point to another (commonly referred to as a “march”). Both types of demonstrations are subject to the criteria outlined in this section.
The following conditions apply to demonstrations taking place on City of Ottawa streets.
Demonstrations having less than 150 participants shall be restricted to the sidewalk.
Demonstrations having more than 150 participants may use part of the roadway. The extent of the road use shall be determined by municipal staff or a police officer.
Demonstrations shall not interfere with the passage of pedestrians. 
Demonstrations having less than 150 participants conducted outside an embassy or other internationally protected property shall be restricted to the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street. Demonstrations having more than 150 participants conducted outside an embassy or other internationally protected property may use part of the roadway adjacent to the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street. The Ottawa Police shall determine the precise parameters of the demonstration and whether the use of the roadway is required.

	The sidewalk directly in front of the embassy or other internationally protected property must be kept clear for security and safety reasons. If no sidewalk exists, the demonstration shall not be permitted within 20 m of the fence surrounding the embassy or other internationally protected property, or if no fence exists, within 20 m of the building face. Depending on the nature of the demonstration, a distance greater than 20 m may be required for security reasons. This shall be determined by the Police Service protecting the embassy or other internationally protected property.

	These restrictions are considered appropriate given the special status of internationally protected properties/persons and the increased security implications when a demonstration is occurring in the immediate vicinity.
Demonstrations having less than 150 participants conducted outside a non-internationally protected property shall be restricted to the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street. Demonstrations having more than 150 participants conducted outside a non-internationally protected property may use part of the roadway adjacent to the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street. The Ottawa Police shall determine the precise parameters of the demonstration and whether the use of the roadway is required.

	If no sidewalk exists, the demonstration shall not be permitted within 15 m of the establishment. The Ottawa Police and/or municipal staff may make exceptions for small demonstrations or when it is more practical for the participants to be in front of the establishment.
Signs or banners, other than plastic foam core signs, must be made of cardboard or cloth/nylon. Plastic foam core signs must be limited to 1.0 cm in thickness, 41.0 cm in width and 61.0 cm in length. All types of signs or banners must be supported by cardboard or softwood supports no larger than 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm. These supports must not exceed 2.0 m in length. The ends of the supports must not be pointed or sharp.
In accordance with the old Corporation of the City of Ottawa Noise By-law Number 3-97, the use of sound reproduction devices during special events is authorized between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. so long as the police are satisfied that said devices are being “used in a reasonable manner” (i.e. the volume is not intolerably high so as to unreasonably disturb the peace and comfort of any person in any dwelling house, apartment house, hotel or other type of residence).
In accordance with Article 2.6.3.4 of the Ontario Fire Code made under the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, 1997, open air burning is not permitted unless approved, or unless such burning consists of a small, confined fire, supervised at all times, and used to cook food on a grill or a barbecue.
Police supervision is required for a demonstration. It is the responsibility of the demonstration organizer to contact the Ottawa Police to arrange for supervision. The demonstration organizer may be responsible for any costs associated with the provision of this service.
It is the responsibility of the demonstration organizer, or designate, to ensure that the demonstration does not block private accesses.
It is the responsibility of the demonstration organizer, or designate, to ensure that any litter generated as a result of the demonstration is picked up.
It is the responsibility of the demonstration organizer to inform the police of his/her name and/or that of his/her designate prior to its occurrence.
The demonstration organizer, or designate, must identify himself/herself to the police supervising the event and must be present at the demonstration site until the event is terminated.
It is the responsibility of the demonstration organizer, or designate, to ensure that any lawful instruction issued by a police officer is obeyed.
It is the responsibility of the demonstration organizer, or designate, to ensure that these criteria are adhered to.
The police may require barricades or traffic safety devices at a demonstration site. Costs associated with their delivery, erection and removal shall be borne by the City.
The provision of a completed and signed Statement of Indemnification by the applicant or a person with signing authority within the organization making application is required.
The demonstration organizer is forewarned that an approved demonstration may be arbitrarily moved or altered in response to an emergency situation. The use of this authority shall not be unreasonably applied.


Guidelines for route marshalls


1.0 Introduction
You have volunteered to assume the responsibilities of a route marshall for a special event. This function is important and essential to ensure the event’s success. You are representing the organization sponsoring the event when meeting the public. Your actions will reflect positively or negatively on both the organization sponsoring the event and the event itself.
Keep in mind that while many people enjoy special events and make an effort to participate in or view them, this enthusiasm is not necessarily shared by all. Many people are working or attending other events or appointments, some of which may be within the barricaded area, and require access. Local residents may also require special assistance to access or leave their homes. Other people may simply wish to circumvent the affected area. You should be prepared to deal with these situations and determine ahead of time how to properly respond.
This explains the responsibilities of route marshalls.
2.0 General Rules
Be at your post at least twenty minutes before your portion of the event route needs to be secured.


Be dressed for the weather, not just for conditions at the start of the event but weather changes that could develop during the event.


Be prepared to sustain some physical discomfort while waiting to be relieved in order to get to a washroom facility.


Bring snack foods and fluids such as bottled water, juices and soft drinks with you (ABSOLUTELY NO ALCOHOL).


Take your garbage with you. Nothing will antagonize the local residents against the event sponsor more than leaving your site dirty.

Bring snack foods and fluids such as bottled water, juices and soft drinks with you (ABSOLUTELY NO ALCOHOL).
Take your garbage with you. Nothing will antagonize the local residents against the event sponsor more than leaving your site dirty.
3.0 Specific Instructions
As a route marshall, you will be assigned to an intersection either along the event route or one block from the route. The responsibilities of the route marshalls differ depending on the assigned intersection. For this reason, they are detailed separately as follows.
Place the barricade across the centre of the intersecting street immediately adjacent to the event route when this is requested of you.
Assist traffic to continue crossing the event route after route closure until you are instructed to have a complete closure.
Signal to the barricade attendant one block back when you are instructed that traffic can no longer cross the event route. From that point, only local traffic should be circulating between the barricades at the event route and one block back.
If approached by a motorist who insists on crossing the event route after you have been instructed that traffic can no longer cross it, explain that if he or she wishes to wait you will be happy to assist him or her across the route when you are instructed that it is safe to do so. To minimize the wait time as much as possible, inform the event organizer that there is someone at your assigned intersection waiting to cross the route if you have the communication means available.
Residents and businesses along dead end streets that intersect the event route are particularly impacted and especially those requiring access from the affected properties. Special consideration needs to be given to those affected at these locations.
Emergency vehicles must always be able to cross the event route. You therefore must be ready to assist these vehicles across safely at any time.
At designated transit crossover points, 
only
 buses can cross an event in progress and 
only
 under Police supervision. When assigned an intersection that is a designated transit crossover point, you will have to assist with this operation by following Police direction.
If parking is permitted along the event route, assist motorists parked along the route to depart when it is safe to do so.
You may need to inform motorists how to get around the closed portion of the event route once traffic can no longer cross it. Prior to reporting to your assigned location, you should discuss this with the event organizer to ensure that the correct information is conveyed.
If approached by a motorist you are unable to assist, offer to contact the event organizer if you have the communication means available. Occasionally, you may come into contact with a motorist who refuses to comply with your instructions. If this occurs, be firm and request assistance from the event organizer or the Police.
When an event appears to have concluded, do not leave or move the barricade until you are instructed to do so.
When instructed to do so, return the barricade to an appropriate location off the roadway which will not interfere with vehicle or pedestrian movement (generally where it was found).
Place the barricade across the lane(s) of traffic leading to the event route immediately adjacent to the roadway one block from the route when this is requested of you.
Assist local traffic to enter or exit from homes and businesses within the closed area.
If approached by a motorist who insists on crossing the event route after you have been instructed that traffic can no longer cross it, invite him or her to wait at the next barricade by the event route until such time instruction is given that the route can be safely crossed. If the motorist wishes to wait, be sure to suggest that he or she advise the barricade attendant by the event route so that the event organizer can be informed that there is someone at that particular location waiting to cross the route if the communication means are available. This will minimize the wait time as much as possible.
Emergency vehicles responding to an emergency must be permitted and assisted through your barricade as quickly and safely as possible.
If the cross street is a designated transit crossover point, you will need to provide access to buses while being careful not to permit access to other through traffic once instructed that non-transit traffic can no longer cross the event route.
You will need to inform motorists how to divert the closed portion of the event route once traffic can no longer cross it. You may also be asked how to avoid the area completely. Prior to reporting to your assigned location, you should discuss this with the event organizer to ensure that the correct information is conveyed.
If approached by a motorist you are unable to assist, offer to contact the event organizer if you have the communication means available.
When an event appears to have concluded, do not leave or move the barricade until you are instructed to do so.
When instructed to do so, return the barricade to an appropriate location off the roadway which will not interfere with vehicle or pedestrian movement (generally where it was found).
Again, as a route marshall, you are taking on an important responsibility. You are the person members of the public will identify as being representative of the organization sponsoring the event. So above all make friends not enemies, always be courteous and as helpful as possible, be quick to volunteer the reason for the road closures, and NEVER ENDANGER THE SPECTATORS OR PARTICIPANTS.
Thank you for volunteering. 


Other events


Events which require road closures but are not demonstrations, sidewalk sales, residential block parties, donation stations, parades or sports events include: festivals, carnivals, street dances, outdoor masses, fun-a-thons and various fund-raising activities. These temporary road closures are typically of long duration and are separate from road closures required for parades and sports events in that they are required to accommodate non-moving events. City of Ottawa streets also need to be closed sporadically for filming requirements and to accommodate events not staged on the road that is closed.
The following conditions apply to events other than demonstrations, sidewalk sales, parades and sports events (hereinafter referred to as “event”) that require City of Ottawa street closures.
Adequate provision for bus service is essential when planning an event. A City street that is a public transit route shall not be closed for an event unless there exists an acceptable parallel road that can be used as an alternate public transit route.
An acceptable detour must exist that is safe and able to accommodate the redistributed traffic and the different kinds of traffic without adversely affecting through traffic patterns. Factors such as estimated traffic volumes, turning radii and parking will be used to determine if an available detour is acceptable.
It is the responsibility of the event organizer to provide all required barricades on the advice of municipal staff or the police.
It is the responsibility of the event organizer to ensure that all streets that intersect with the closed portion of roadway are completely barricaded at all times and that volunteers are stationed at these intersections to ensure that they remain closed, unless there is a need for one or more barricade to be moved to accommodate local traffic or the police otherwise instruct.
It is the responsibility of the event organizer to ensure that barricades and trained volunteers are positioned at both ends of the road closure at all times to assist emergency vehicles and those with legitimate business through the barricaded area, as well as ensure that a 5.0 m passageway is kept clear of obstacles at all times within the road closure so that emergency vehicles can proceed through unimpeded.
An information pamphlet titled “Guidelines For Route Marshalls” shall be made available to event organizers by municipal staff. It is the event organizer’s responsibility to ensure that their volunteers understand what is expected of them prior to the event beginning.
An event will not be permitted on a City street from Monday to Friday (statutory holidays excepted) between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m..nd comfort of any person in any dwelling house, apartment house, hotel or other type of residence).

Temporary detour and/or advance warning signs required to facilitate the event shall be erected, maintained and removed by municipal staff at the City’s cost.
It is the responsibility of the event organizer to provide details of the event to residences, businesses, churches and any other institution or organization that may be impacted by the event a minimum of 10 days in advance of the event. Furthermore, the event organizer will work with business representatives, etc., to minimize any inconvenience the event may cause.
It is the responsibility of the event organizer to ensure that any litter generated as a result of the event is picked up.
Ads published in the three major local newspapers which provide road closure details, recommend alternate routes and provide information relating to available alternate transit routes, may be required. Whether or not this is required will depend on anticipated traffic implications. If required, the City will assume this responsibility to inform the police of his/her name and/or that of his/her designate prior to its occurrence.
Some or all costs associated with the provision of police resources (both human and vehicular) required to safely secure the event may be charged to the event organizer. The extent of required police resources shall be determined by the police or municipal staff. A permit may be subject to summary cancellation if adequate police supervision is not secured before the commencement of the event.
In accordance with the old Corporation of the City of Ottawa Noise By-law Number 3-97, the use of sound reproduction devices during special events is authorized between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. so long as the police are satisfied that said devices are being “used in a reasonable manner” (i.e. the volume is not intolerably high so as to unreasonably disturb the peace and comfort of any person in any dwelling house, apartment house, hotel or other type of residence).
The applicant shall provide and maintain Comprehensive General Liability or Special Events Liability insurance subject to limits of not less than Two Million ($2,000,000.00) Dollars inclusive per occurrence for bodily injury, death and damage to property.

Failure to comply with any of the above criteria during an approved event may result in the ‘two strike rule’ being applied against the organization (or organizer) that requested the Special Event Permit. The ‘two strike rule’ is a penalty provision whereby in situations of non-compliance during an approved event, staff will work with the organizer to ensure compliance during subsequent events. If non-compliance occurs a second time, a subsequent application from the same organization (or organizer) will not be considered for a period of two years from the time the second violation occurred (in other words a one year penalty for organizations that have annual events and a two year penalty for organizations that have more frequent and less involved events to plan). Time permitting, event organizers have the option of appealing a decision of the Transportation, Utilities and Public Works General Manager to the Transportation and Transit Committee.
The event organizer is forewarned that an approved event may be arbitrarily altered or cancelled in response to an emergency situation. The use of this authority shall not be unreasonably applied.


Parades and sports events


The following conditions apply to parades or sports events staged in whole or in part on City of Ottawa streets. Conditions apply to both where “event” is used.
Adequate provision for bus service is essential when planning an event route. A City street that is a public transit route shall not be closed for an event unless there exists an acceptable parallel road that can be used as an alternate public transit route.
The primary downtown Transitway corridor consisting of Albert and Slater Streets and the Mackenzie King Bridge shall not be considered as potential sections of event routes.
The crossing of Rideau Street at Sussex Drive or MacKenzie Avenue or the crossing of the Rideau Canal on Rideau Street or Laurier Avenue shall not be included as part of a parade or sports event route if the magnitude of the event may cause northbound traffic on Nicholas Street to back up onto Highway 417 or southbound traffic on King Edward Avenue to back up and restrict traffic exiting the Macdonald Cartier Bridge.
During an approved event, public transit must be maintained to the greatest extent possible. As such, police officers, at the event organizer’s cost, must be stationed at all locations where public transit routes intersect the event route. Buses must be assisted through the intersections periodically to maintain to the greatest extent possible the integrity of the regularly scheduled transit service.
When a City street is closed for an event, and a residential or business area has no other access point, a police officer, at the event organizer’s cost, must be stationed at the main access corridor to the closed-off area to assist emergency vehicles and those with legitimate business through the intersection.
An event will not be permitted on a City street during weekday peak traffic hours (7:00 a.m. - 9:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m.). Statutory holidays are excepted.
A parade will not be permitted to double back on its route or reverse its direction. This significantly increases the time that traffic is unable to cross the parade route. Exceptions may be made where practicable.
It is the responsibility of the event organizer to ensure that an approved event starts on time. The event organizer is responsible for additional policing costs incurred as a result of the delay. This does not apply if the event is delayed for reasons beyond the event organizer’s control.
Traffic, except emergency vehicles and buses under police supervision, shall not be permitted to cross a parade route until the parade has passed
It is the responsibility of the event organizer to provide all required barricades on the advice of municipal staff or the Ottawa Police.
All streets that intersect with an approved parade route that are not bus routes shall be barricaded, unless municipal or police officials indicate otherwise. It is the responsibility of the event organizer to ensure that each barricaded street is staffed by a courteous and trained volunteer to assist emergency vehicles only through the barricades.
Barricades supported by “Road Closed - Local Traffic Only” signs shall also be placed one block back from an approved event route. Volunteers must also be positioned at these locations to assist any person having legitimate business between such barricades and the approved event route, unless municipal or police officials indicate otherwise.
Training courses for volunteers staffing barricades are offered by the Ottawa Police for major events if requested. An information pamphlet titled “Guidelines For Route Marshalls” shall also be made available to event organizers by municipal staff. It is the event organizer’s responsibility to ensure that their volunteers understand what is expected of them prior to the event beginning.
Volunteers stationed along the event route shall remove the barricades and thereby open their intersections to traffic as the last event participant passes them or as directed by the police.
Temporary regulatory signs and alterations to traffic control signal displays or timing phases may be required to facilitate the event. These services, if required, shall be performed by municipal staff at the City’s cost.
Temporary detour and/or advance warning signs may be required by municipal staff or the police to divert traffic away from the vicinity of the event. If required, they shall be erected, maintained and removed by municipal staff at the City’s cost.
It is the responsibility of the event organizer to provide details of the event to residences, businesses, churches and any other institution or organization that may be impacted by the event a minimum of 10 days in advance of the event. Furthermore, the event organizer will work with business representatives, etc., to minimize any inconvenience the event may cause.
It is the responsibility of the event organizer to ensure that any litter generated as a result of the event is picked up.
Ads published in the three major local newspapers which provide road closure details, recommend alternate routes and provide information relating to available alternate transit routes, may be required. Whether or not this is required will depend on anticipated traffic implications. If required, the City will assume this responsibility.
Some or all costs associated with the provision of police resources (both human and vehicular) required to safely secure the event may be charged to the event organizer. The extent of required police resources shall be determined by the police or municipal staff. A permit may be subject to summary cancellation if adequate police supervision is not secured before the commencement of the event.
In accordance with the old Corporation of the City of Ottawa Noise By-law Number 3-97, the use of sound reproduction devices during special events is authorized between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. so long as the police are satisfied that said devices are being “used in a reasonable manner” (i.e. the volume is not intolerably high so as to unreasonably disturb the peace and comfort of any person in any dwelling house, apartment house, hotel or other type of residence).
Major parades and other special events that require complete road closures on Bank Street between the Queensway and Lansdowne Park are limited to:

one on a Saturday between 1 January and 30 April;


one on a Saturday between 1 May and 31 August;


one on a Saturday between 1 September and 31 December, and


the Pride Parade on a Sunday each year. With respect to the Saturday events, the administering of the application process shall be based on seniority unless the previous year’s event does not re-occur, in which case any substitute event may be approved on a first come first served basis. Other proposals to close Bank Street completely for a special event (i.e. over and above the three major parades on Saturdays and Pride Parade on Sunday each year) may be considered either to celebrate extraordinary achievements (i.e. Stanley Cup Parade) or something like a Central Canada Exhibition Parade.

Such insurance shall be in the name of the applicant and shall name the City of Ottawa as an additional insured thereunder. Exceptions may be made for parades when the liability implications are minimal. When insurance is required, other jurisdictions such as the National Capital Commission will also need to be co-insured if its roads are closed as a result of an event occurring on a City street.
The provision of a completed and signed Statement of Indemnification by the applicant or a person with signing authority within the organization making application is required.
Failure to comply with any of the above criteria during an approved event may result in the ‘two strike rule’ being applied against the organization (or organizer) that requested the Special Event Permit.

The event organizer is forewarned that an approved event may arbitrarily altered or cancelled in response to an emergency situation. The use of this authority shall not be unreasonably applied.


Residential block parties


Definition: For our purposes, a residential block party may include a barbecue, dance or any like social event that the majority of residents living within the street closure limits support.
The following conditions apply to residential block parties conducted on City of Ottawa streets.
Barricades are required at both ends of the street to be closed at all times.
It is the responsibility of the event organizer to ensure that volunteers are positioned at both ends of the street closure at all times to facilitate local access and assist emergency vehicles through the barricaded area if necessary. To this end, a 5.0 m passageway must be kept clear of obstacles within the closure so that emergency vehicles can proceed through unimpeded.
It is the responsibility of the event organizer to make every effort to ensure that those residing within the block closure limits are informed of the event details.
It is the responsibility of the event organizer to ensure that any litter generated as a result of the event is picked up. 
In accordance with the old Corporation of the City of Ottawa Noise By-law Number 3-97, the use of sound reproduction devices during special events is authorized between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. so long as the police are satisfied that said devices are being “used in a reasonable manner” (i.e. the volume is not intolerably high so as to unreasonably disturb the peace and comfort of any person in any dwelling house, apartment house, hotel or other type of residence).

	If a police officer or municipal official determines that the use of sound reproduction devices disturbs the peace and comfort of any person in any dwelling house, apartment house, hotel or other type of residence, the permit holder shall ensure that the volume of said devices is turned down to an appropriate level upon request of the officer or official.

	If the use of sound reproduction devices during the approved residential block party results in further substantiated noise complaints, future street closure requests to close the same street will not be approved by the City of Ottawa.
The provision of a completed and signed Statement of Indemnification by the applicant or a person with signing authority within the organization making application is required.
In situations where complaints are received following an approved residential block party, verification of the level of support for a subsequent request at the same location will be required. In such instances, it is the responsibility of the event organizer to petition the residents within the proposed street closure limits to determine their support, or lack of, for the proposed block party. Only one signature per residence will be considered. A majority in support of the proposal, or more than 50 percent, is required (i.e. if there are 20 residences located within the proposed block closure limits a minimum of 11 signatures in support of the proposal from 11 different residences are required).


Sidewalk sales


The following conditions apply to sidewalk sales conducted on City of Ottawa streets.
The applicant must represent a Business Improvement Area, or if a Business Improvement Area does not exist, must represent the majority of the other merchants on the street wishing to participate in the sidewalk sale. A Special Event Permit will not be issued to an individual merchant making application in isolation.
It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that each business within the limits of the proposed sidewalk sale receives adequate prior notification and is given an opportunity to participate.
It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that each merchant participating in the sidewalk sale is provided with a copy of the permit.
It is the responsibility of the applicant to install, maintain and remove any barricades that may be required by municipal staff or the Ottawa Police.
No tables or barricades shall be permitted within 6.0 m of an intersection.
There must be a minimum of 1.5 m of clear sidewalk space maintained at all times.
Access must be maintained at bus stops for buses loading and discharging passengers.
Access must not be denied to sellers wishing to exercise their rights to vend on the sidewalk or persons who ordinarily have legal access to the sidewalk.
Merchants participating in the sidewalk sale shall be restricted to the sidewalk/roadway within the boundary lines of their establishment as extended across the sidewalk/roadway. Merchants wishing to use sidewalk/roadway space in front of an adjacent or any other establishment as part of their display require the written approval of that establishment’s proprietor.
It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that any litter generated as a result of the sidewalk sale is picked up.
Temporary No Stopping signs and parking meter covers may be necessary if the use of the curb lanes in addition to the sidewalks is also required for the sidewalk sale. These services, if required, shall be performed by municipal staff at the event organizer’s cost.
If the use of the curb lanes in addition to the sidewalks is also required for the sidewalk sale, the roadway must be kept clear of all infrastructure (i.e. barricades, traffic cones, tables, merchandise, etc.) during weekday peak traffic hours (7:00 a.m. – 9:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.). Statutory holidays are excepted.
The applicant shall provide and maintain Comprehensive General Liability or Special Events Liability insurance subject to limits of not less than Two Million ($2,000,000.00) Dollars inclusive per occurrence for bodily injury, death and damage to property. Such insurance shall be in the name of the applicant and shall name the City of Ottawa as an additional insured thereunder.
The provision of a completed and signed Statement of Indemnification by the applicant or a person with signing authority within the organization making application is required.
Failure to comply with any of the above criteria during an approved sidewalk sale may result in the ‘two strike rule’ being applied against the organization (or organizer) that requested the Special Event Permit. The ‘two strike rule’ is a penalty provision whereby in situations of non-compliance during an approved sidewalk sale, staff will work with the organizer to ensure compliance during subsequent events. If non-compliance occurs a second time, a subsequent application from the same organization (or organizer) will not be considered for a period of two years from the time the second violation occurred (in other words a one year penalty for organizations that have annual events and a two year penalty for organizations that have more frequent and less involved events to plan). Time permitting, event organizers have the option of appealing a decision of the Transportation, Utilities and Public Works General Manager to the Transportation and Transit Committee.
The event organizer is forewarned that an approved sidewalk sale may be arbitrarily altered or cancelled in response to an emergency situation. The use of this authority shall not be unreasonably applied.
