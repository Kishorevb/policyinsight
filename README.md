PolicyInsight: A Dynamic Framework for Efficient Government Policy Monitoring

In this work, we are aiming to develop an efficient and a comprehensive policy monitoring framework with the following features:

Real-time monitoring: The framework involves real-time monitoring of government policy documents, ensuring that the information is always up to date.

Adaptability to Changes: With a novel policy data model, the system is designed to adapt seamlessly to changes in the structure or content of policy documents. It can dynamically adjust to modifications in document formats, new policy sections, or alterations in the way information is presented.

Intelligent Analytical Insights: State-of-the-art NLP techniques and LLMs are leveraged for better understanding and categorization of policy content and derive change detection and impact analysis.

Responsive User Interface: The user interface of the monitoring system is responsive and user-friendly. It allows users to interact with the interested data in a dynamic manner, facilitating efficient exploration, analysis, and tracking of policy updates.

Automated Alerts and Notifications: The dynamic approach includes the implementation of automated alert systems. Users can receive notifications in real-time when significant policy changes occur, allowing for prompt response and analysis.

Scalability and Performance: The system is designed to scale efficiently, accommodating an increasing volume of policy documents and users. Performance optimization is a key aspect, ensuring that the dynamic monitoring process remains efficient even as the dataset grows.
